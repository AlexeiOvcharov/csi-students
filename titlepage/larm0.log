with that big value; but it might be dangerous.

So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.

I need a `known' x value for this part of the path.
The value I found (see above) was no good;
so I'll try to keep going by using zero instead.
(Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook explains that
you might want to type `I ???' now.)

The path doesn't have a counterclockwise orientation,
so I'll probably have trouble drawing it.

The path doesn't have a counterclockwise orientation,
so I'll probably have trouble drawing it.

At least one of the coordinates in the path I'm about to

So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.
